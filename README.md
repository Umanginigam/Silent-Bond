Overview

This project aims to create a machine learning model that can detect and interpret sign language gestures from images or video streams. The model can be used to facilitate communication for people with hearing impairments by translating sign language into text or spoken language.

Features

Real-Time Detection: Supports real-time detection and interpretation of sign language gestures.

Multiple Sign Language Support: Can be trained to recognize different sign languages (e.g., ASL, BSL).

Customizable Model: Users can fine-tune the model with their own datasets.

Export Model: Save trained models for deployment in applications or mobile devices.

Installation

Prerequisites

Python 3.x
Required libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.

Dataset:
The project can use publicly available sign language datasets or custom datasets. Example datasets include:

ASL Alphabet Dataset - For American Sign Language.
Sign Language MNIST - A simplified dataset for sign language digits.
To use your own dataset, place the images in the data/ directory, organized by gesture label.

Parameters:

--dataset_path: Path to the dataset directory.

--epochs: Number of training epochs.

--batch_size: Batch size for training.

--model_output: Path to save the trained model.

Model Architecture:

The model is built using a convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to recognize hand gestures. It includes layers such as:

Convolutional Layers: For feature extraction.

Pooling Layers: To reduce dimensionality.

Fully Connected Layers: For classification.

The architecture can be customized and improved based on specific requirements.

Workflow:

Data Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and augmented for training.

Model Training: The CNN model is trained on labeled gesture images.

Evaluation: Model performance is evaluated using validation data.

Detection: The trained model is used to detect and classify gestures from images or video streams.
